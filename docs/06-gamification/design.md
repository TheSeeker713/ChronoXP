## Philosophy: Safe Gamification

ChronoXP gamification is **discovery, not achievement**. We celebrate progress without creating pressure.

### Core Principles
1. **Growth as exploration:** XP unlocks artifacts to discover, not badges to earn
2. **No shame mechanics:** Never punish for gaps, only celebrate when you do write
3. **Intrinsic motivation:** Reward reflection and starting, not grinding
4. **Optional by design:** Can be completely hidden via "Simple Mode"
5. **Cozy, not competitive:** Personal progress space, no leaderboards

## XP System

### What Earns XP

| Action | XP Awarded | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Write entry (50+ words) | +10 | One-time per entry |
| Return after 3+ day gap | +5 | "Welcome back" bonus |
| Complete reflection prompt | +15 | Optional quest |
| Tag 5 entries (batch) | +5 | Encourages organization |
| Use semantic search | +2 | First 3 times (tutorial nudge) |
| Export .chrxp | +5 | One-time (encourages backups) |

**Total XP range for typical user:**
- Week 1: ~50-100 XP (3-5 entries + exploration)
- Month 1: ~200-400 XP (consistent journaling)
- Year 1: ~2000-4000 XP (regular use, occasional quests)

---

### What Does NOT Earn XP

❌ **Daily logins** (no streak pressure)  
❌ **Word count grinding** (quality > quantity)  
❌ **Social sharing** (privacy-first)  
❌ **Forced actions** (e.g., "rate this entry")  
❌ **Speed bonuses** (no time pressure)

---

### XP Display

#### Option A: Minimal (Default)
- **Toolbar badge:** Small XP counter (e.g., "XP: 250") in top-right
- **Unobtrusive:** Fades to 50% opacity when not hovering
- **Toggle:** Can be hidden entirely in Settings

#### Option B: Simple Mode
- **No XP display** anywhere in UI
- XP still accumulates in background (if user later disables Simple Mode)

---

## Artifacts

### Design

**Visual style:** Hand-painted RPG aesthetic — every asset is digitally painted by artists (like Skyrim texture work)

**Art direction:**
- **Fully hand-painted assets:** Every artifact, shelf, stone, and texture painted in Photoshop/Procreate
- Classic fantasy RPG feel (think Skyrim, Elder Scrolls, Baldur's Gate) but 2D side-view
- Painterly brush strokes visible on close inspection (not photo-realistic, artisanal)
- Warm, lived-in fantasy aesthetic: weathered wood, aged leather, patinated brass
- Rich color palette: amber candlelight, deep forest greens, twilight blues, warm stone grays
- Texture depth: visible wood grain, fabric weave, leather creases, stone moss
- No pixel art, no vectors — pure digital painting with visible brush work

**Lighting & atmosphere:**
- Soft, painterly lighting (not harsh CG)
- Ambient occlusion painted into textures (classic game art technique)
- Light sources feel natural: flickering candles, warm fireplace glow
- Subtle rim lighting on artifacts (hand-painted highlights, not shader effects)
- Atmospheric depth: distant objects softer/cooler, close objects sharp/warm

**Placement:**
- Displayed in Records Cavern (2D side-view room, classic RPG location aesthetic)
- Arranged organically in scene (not grid-based) — artifacts rest on hand-painted shelves, tables, stone ledges
- Each artifact hand-painted at multiple angles (idle state, hover state, zoomed closeup)
- Can be clicked for flavor text (classic adventure game interaction)
- Hover states: subtle hand-painted glow effect (like enchanted items in RPGs)

### Artifact List (MVP)

| XP Threshold | Artifact | Flavor Text |
|--------------|----------|-------------|
| 10 | **First Journal** | "A well-worn journal, its pages filled with the echoes of your thoughts." |
| 50 | **Memory Jar** | "A glass jar filled with paper scraps, each one holding a fleeting memory." |
| 100 | **Ancient Scroll** | "A scroll from another time, reminding you that reflection is timeless." |
| 200 | **Cozy Lantern** | "A warm glow to light your way through the cavern of memory." |
| 400 | **Bookshelf** | "A collection of stories — some finished, some still being written." |
| 800 | **Star Map** | "A map of constellations you've charted through your own words." |
| 1600 | **Crystal Geode** | "A hidden beauty revealed only through patience and time." |
| 3200 | **Time Compass** | "It doesn't point north — it points to the moments that matter." |

**Unlock cadence:** Exponential curve (early unlocks fast, later unlocks slower but more special)

---

### Future Artifacts (Post-MVP)

- **Seasonal:** "Autumn Wreath" (unlocked in fall), "Winter Candle" (winter)
- **Quest-specific:** "Reflection Mirror" (complete 10 reflection prompts)
- **Milestone:** "Thousand Words" (write 1000+ words in single entry)
- **Custom:** User-uploaded images as artifacts

---

## Records Cavern

### Visual Design

**Style:** Hand-painted 2D fantasy RPG location — every element digitally painted by artists

**Inspiration:**
- Skyrim/Elder Scrolls texture work: all hand-painted, painterly detail
- Classic RPG interiors: cozy taverns, wizard towers, scholar's libraries
- Concept art quality: not polished CG, visible brush strokes and artistic choices
- Warm, lived-in spaces (think D&D campaign settings brought to life)

**Art production approach:**
- **Backgrounds:** Large canvas paintings (4K+) with atmospheric perspective
- **Assets:** Each artifact, book, candle painted individually with texture variations
- **Layered composition:** Background, mid-ground, foreground painted as separate layers
- **Visible craftsmanship:** Brush strokes, color blending, texture work evident on zoom
- **Traditional RPG feel:** Not sterile/modern, but aged, historical, magical

**Layout:**
```
🏔️ ⛰️ (distant mountains - soft atmospheric painting)
    🌲 🌲 🏛️ 🌲 (mid-ground: hand-painted stone archway, ancient trees)
      📚 🕯️ 🏺 🪴 (artifacts on weathered stone shelves)
    ┌─────────────────┐
    │   Wooden Desk   │ (central focus: leather journal, brass quill, ceramic inkwell)
    └─────────────────┘
  ════════════════════ (cobblestone floor with hand-painted moss and age)
```

**Material textures (all hand-painted):**
- **Wood:** Visible grain patterns, knots, aged varnish, scratches
- **Stone:** Chisel marks, moss growth, weathering, color variation
- **Metal:** Patina on brass, tarnish, hammered texture, reflective highlights
- **Fabric:** Weave patterns, frayed edges, color fading, stains from use
- **Leather:** Creases, embossing, worn corners, natural grain
- **Paper:** Texture, yellowing, ink stains, dog-eared corners

**Lighting (painted, not dynamic):**
- **Primary light:** Warm fireplace glow painted into scene (left side warmth)
- **Secondary light:** Candlelight with painted halos and soft falloff
- **Ambient:** Cool moonlight through arched window (blue-purple tones)
- **Shadows:** Hand-painted soft shadows and ambient occlusion baked into textures
- **Atmosphere:** Painted light rays through dust, warm/cool color temperature zones
- **Subtle animation:** Flickering candles (frame-by-frame painted variations)

**Parallax scrolling (if user pans camera):**
- Background mountains: 0.3x speed (atmospheric, impressionistic painting)
- Mid-ground trees/archway: 0.6x speed (detailed but softer)
- Shelves and artifacts: 1.0x speed (highest detail, sharp focus)
- Foreground elements (desk edge, potted plants): 1.2x speed (very sharp, warm tones)

### Evolution Over Time

**Cavern progression:** Like discovering new RPG locations as you level up — each stage is a completely new hand-painted scene

| XP Range | Cavern State | Visual Description |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| 0-50 | **Humble Study** | Simple stone chamber, rough-hewn walls, single weathered oak desk, lone candle casting warm light, 1-2 artifacts (journal, inkwell), small arched window showing dusk sky |
| 50-200 | **Growing Archive** | Stone shelves installed (hand-carved details visible), wrought iron lanterns on walls, 3-5 artifacts displayed, potted fern in corner, rolled maps on desk, warm amber glow |
| 200-800 | **Scholar's Library** | Vaulted stone ceiling, floor-to-ceiling bookshelves (aged leather spines), decorative tapestry (faded blues/golds), 6-10 artifacts arranged, reading nook with velvet cushions, brass telescope by window |
| 800-1600 | **Grand Repository** | Expanded space with spiral staircase to loft, ornate carved furniture, mystical artifacts with subtle painted glow, stained glass window (moonlight filters through), fireplace with crackling logs, 11-15 artifacts |
| 1600+ | **Master's Sanctum** | Multi-level chamber with library ladder, cozy alcoves with cushioned benches, enchanted items (painted arcane runes), fireplace mantle with artifacts, observatory window showing cosmic vista, hanging plants, 16+ artifacts organically placed |

**Art production notes:**
- Each stage is a new master painting (not just additions to previous scene)
- Crossfade transitions between paintings (gentle, atmospheric)
- Artifacts appear with soft painted glow effect (subtle, hand-painted bloom)
- Lighting mood evolves: candlelight → lanterns → fireplace → mystical glow
- Background details tell story: more books, older artifacts, richer materials

**No decay:** Once unlocked, can revisit any cavern stage (like RPG fast travel between discovered locations).

### Interaction

**Classic RPG/adventure game controls:**

**Click artifact (examine interaction):**
- Cursor changes to hand-painted "examine" icon (magnifying glass or hand) on hover
- Click opens modal with detailed hand-painted closeup of artifact + flavor text
- Closeup shows texture detail: scratches on brass, grain in wood, age in leather
- Shows unlock date and XP milestone in hand-lettered style
- (Future) Link to related entries (e.g., "Memory Jar" → entries tagged "memory")
- Modal design: Hand-painted parchment background (visible texture), serif fantasy font, "close" button as wax seal or brass clasp

**Pan cavern:**
- Click + drag to pan camera (like exploring wide RPG environments)
- Or keyboard arrows (accessibility) — smooth scrolling with painted parallax layers
- Reveals hidden areas: side alcoves, upper shelves, distant corners
- Panning feels like moving through painted space (like background scrolling in classic RPGs)

**Zoom:**
- Scroll wheel (or pinch on touchpad)
- Zoom reveals hand-painted texture detail: brush strokes, color variations, material textures
- At max zoom, see artistic craftsmanship: paper fiber texture, metal patina, wood grain
- Shows level of care in hand-painted assets

**Easter eggs (RPG tradition):**
- Click hidden books to read hand-painted spines ("The Journaler's Guide to Reflection")
- Click window to see painted weather: rain, snow, sunset, stars
- Occasional painted animations: cat silhouette crossing window, fireflies (frame-by-frame painted)
- Hidden artifacts: click moss patch to find painted mushrooms, click bookshelf corner for aged note

## Progress Bar

**Location:** Bottom of Records Cavern screen (integrated into painted scene)

**Display:**
```
Progress to next unlock: ████████░░ 80%
Next: "Ancient Scroll" (20 XP away)
```

**Design (hand-painted UI element):**
- Styled as hand-painted wooden plaque or aged brass plate (diegetic, part of scene)
- Progress bar is painted glass vial or hourglass with glowing fill (warm amber/gold)
- Fill texture hand-painted: visible brush strokes, subtle color gradients, organic edges (not perfect geometric)
- Background: weathered wood texture with carved details or brass with verdigris patina
- Text hand-lettered in serif fantasy font (readable, elegant)
- Text is encouraging: "You're close!" (not "Almost there!")
- Hover state: Subtle painted glow around edges (like candlelight catching brass)

## Quests (Optional Reflection Prompts)

### Design Principles
- **Suggested, never required**
- **Can be dismissed forever**
- **No penalties for ignoring**
- **Rewards are small (15 XP + artifact progress)**

---

### Quest Examples

#### Quest 1: "Revisit the Past"
**Prompt:** "Read three entries from last month. What themes do you notice?"  
**Reward:** +15 XP  
**Unlock condition:** User has 10+ entries  

#### Quest 2: "Future Self"
**Prompt:** "Write a letter to yourself one year from now. What do you hope to have learned?"  
**Reward:** +15 XP  
**Unlock condition:** User has written 5+ entries  

#### Quest 3: "Gratitude Moment"
**Prompt:** "List three things you're grateful for today, big or small."  
**Reward:** +15 XP  
**Unlock condition:** Always available (classic prompt)  

#### Quest 4: "Pattern Recognition"
**Prompt:** "Search for a recurring word in your journal. Why does it appear often?"  
**Reward:** +15 XP  
**Unlock condition:** User has used semantic search at least once  

---

### Quest UI

**Notification (non-intrusive toast):**
```
┌───────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 💭 New reflection prompt available:  │
│ "Revisit the Past"                    │
│ [View] [Dismiss]                      │
└───────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Quest modal (if user clicks "View"):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Reflection Prompt: Revisit the Past       [×]     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                     │
│  Read three entries from last month.                │
│  What themes do you notice?                         │
│                                                     │
│  This is optional — no pressure if you're not       │
│  in the mood. You can always come back to it.       │
│                                                     │
│  Reward: +15 XP                                     │
│                                                     │
│  [Start Quest] [Maybe Later] [Don't Show Again]    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Completion:**
- User writes entry mentioning themes → Quest auto-completes (AI detection)
- OR user manually marks complete (checkbox in quest log)

## No Streak Mechanics

### What We Don't Do

❌ **"You're on a 14-day streak! Don't break it!"**  
❌ **Red X's on calendar for missed days**  
❌ **Notifications: "You haven't written in 3 days..."**  
❌ **Streak recovery (implies failure)**  

### What We Do Instead

✅ **Calendar shows activity, but gaps are just empty (not red)**  
✅ **"Welcome back!" bonus after 3+ day gap (positive framing)**  
✅ **No pressure to write daily (quality > consistency)**  
✅ **Artifacts don't expire or decay**  

---

## Gamification Tuning

### MVP Tuning Goals
1. **First artifact unlocked in first session** (feels good immediately)
2. **Second artifact within 3-5 sessions** (builds anticipation)
3. **Long-term: 1 artifact per 5-10 entries** (sustainable pace)

### Balancing Act
- **Too fast:** Artifacts lose meaning, feel cheap
- **Too slow:** User never reaches milestones, loses motivation
- **Just right:** Unlocks feel earned but attainable

### Post-Launch Adjustments
- Monitor analytics (if user opts in): Average XP per session, artifact unlock rate
- A/B test: Faster vs. slower unlock cadence
- User feedback: "Too many artifacts" vs. "Not enough rewards"

---

## Simple Mode (Gamification Toggle)

### What It Does
- **Hides:**
  - XP counter
  - Records Cavern
  - Artifact unlock notifications
  - Quest prompts
- **Keeps:**
  - Core journaling features (Canvas, Library, Search, Settings)
  - Data (XP still accumulates in background, artifacts remain unlocked)

### When to Recommend
- User finds gamification stressful (common for anxious or ADHD users)
- User wants pure, minimal journaling (no distractions)
- User is in crisis mode (journaling for mental health, not fun)

### How to Enable
- Settings → Appearance → ☑ Enable Simple Mode
- Toast confirmation: "Simple Mode enabled. You can always turn this off later."

---

## Accessibility in Gamification

### Visual
- **High contrast:** Artifact icons stand out from background
- **Color-blind safe:** No color-only indicators
- **Reduced motion:** Unlock animations simplified (fade-in only)

### Auditory
- **Optional sound:** Soft chime on unlock (can be disabled)
- **Volume control:** Settings → Sound → Artifact unlock volume

### Cognitive
- **No time pressure:** Quests never expire
- **Clear opt-out:** Dismiss quests forever with one click
- **Low cognitive load:** Progress bar uses plain language ("20 XP away", not "80% to threshold")

---

## Ethical Considerations

### What We Avoid (Dark Patterns)
1. **FOMO:** No "limited-time" artifacts or events
2. **Social pressure:** No friend invites, sharing, or leaderboards
3. **Addiction loops:** No daily login rewards or timed bonuses
4. **Pay-to-win:** XP cannot be purchased

### What We Embrace (Ethical Design)
1. **Transparency:** Users know exactly what earns XP (documented in-app)
2. **User control:** Can disable all gamification with one toggle
3. **No manipulation:** XP rewards genuine actions (writing, reflecting), not busywork
4. **Respect for mental health:** Quests suggest, never demand

---

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

### 1. Artifact Placement
- Drag-and-drop artifacts in Cavern
- Save custom layouts
- Share layouts (if user wants, optional)

### 2. Seasonal Events
- "Autumn Reflection Week": Special quests + artifacts
- Opt-in (never forced)

### 3. Milestone Celebrations
- "You've written 100 entries!" (subtle toast, not forced)
- "One year of journaling!" (special artifact unlock)

### 4. Advanced Analytics (Opt-In)
- XP over time graph
- Most-active writing days
- Word count trends
- **Privacy:** Local-only, never sent to servers

---

## Testing & Validation

### Pre-Launch
- [ ] Playtest with 10 users (5 neurotypical, 5 neurodivergent)
- [ ] A/B test: Gamification ON vs. Simple Mode (measure retention, satisfaction)
- [ ] Accessibility audit: Reduced motion, screen reader, keyboard-only

### Post-Launch
- [ ] Monitor: % of users who enable Simple Mode
- [ ] Survey: "Does gamification feel motivating or stressful?"
- [ ] Iterate: Adjust XP thresholds, quest frequency, artifact design
