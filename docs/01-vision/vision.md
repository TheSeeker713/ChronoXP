## Why It Exists

ChronoXP™ exists to fix the **"journaling gap"** — the space between wanting to journal and actually doing it consistently, without shame or pressure.

We're building a calm, fast, private space where both mainstream and neurodivergent users can:

- **Write** freely without judgment
- **Remember** through intelligent, local-first search
- **Reflect** with gentle prompts and visual progress
- **Own their data** completely — nothing leaves the device without explicit action

## Non-Negotiables

### 1. Offline-First
- **No network calls** unless a user explicitly exports or syncs
- All core features work with zero internet connection
- Fast, reliable, local-only operations

### 2. Local-Only AI
- Powered by **llama.cpp** with **GGUF** models
- Works on CPU-only machines with 16 GB RAM
- No data sent to external servers
- Optional model downloads with explicit user consent

### 3. Neuro-Affirming UX
- **Keyboard-first** navigation and interaction
- **Low-stimulation mode** by default
- **No "you missed a day" bullshit** — no streak shaming
- Gentle nudges, not aggressive notifications
- Dyslexia-friendly fonts and accessible design

### 4. Safe Gamification
- Growth as **discovery**, not grades
- **XP system** rewards starting and returning, not grinding
- **Records Cavern**: a cozy 2.5D parallax space that evolves with use
- Unlock artifacts through natural journaling, not forced tasks
- **Everything is toggle-able** — "Simple Mode" hides all gamification

### 5. Data Ownership
- **Encrypted local SQLite** (SQLCipher)
- One-click export to portable **`.chrxp` packet** (Markdown + attachments + database)
- No vendor lock-in
- User owns 100% of their data, forever

## What Success Looks Like

**For the user:**
- They open the app and start writing within seconds
- They find past entries by meaning, not just keywords
- They feel progress without pressure
- They trust that their private thoughts stay private

**For the product:**
- Adoption by both neurotypical and neurodivergent communities
- Zero privacy incidents or data leaks
- Sustainable monetization that never compromises core features
- Active community of contributors and enthusiasts

## What This Is Not

- ❌ Not a productivity tool with aggressive reminders
- ❌ Not a social platform or sharing network
- ❌ Not a cloud-first SaaS with subscription lock-in
- ❌ Not a therapy replacement (though it may complement therapy)
- ❌ Not a data collection engine disguised as a journal

## Design Principles

1. **Calm by default, powerful by choice**
2. **Privacy is not a premium feature**
3. **Friction should only exist where it helps focus**
4. **Progress should feel like discovery, not obligation**
5. **Every user interaction should respect cognitive load**

## The Promise

> *"Your thoughts. Your device. Your pace. No judgment. No tracking. Just a safe space to write, remember, and grow."*
