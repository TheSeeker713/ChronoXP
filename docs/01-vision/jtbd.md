## Overview

These are the core "jobs" that users are hiring ChronoXP to do. Each job represents a moment of frustration or need that our product must address.

## Primary Jobs

### Job 1: Starting Without Friction
**When** I sit down to write  
**I want** a blank, calm space that nudges me just enough to start  
**So I can** overcome the initial resistance without feeling overwhelmed

**Current Alternatives & Pain Points:**
- Physical journals: no prompts, blank page anxiety
- Apps like Day One: cluttered UI, too many options upfront
- Google Docs: feels too formal, not journaling-specific

**Success Criteria:**
- Cursor is auto-focused on launch
- Gentle placeholder text offers optional soft start
- Zero mandatory fields or structure
- First word can be typed within 400ms of opening

---

### Job 2: Finding by Meaning, Not Memory
**When** I search for past entries  
**I want** to find ideas by meaning, not just exact words  
**So I can** discover connections and patterns I've forgotten

**Current Alternatives & Pain Points:**
- Keyword search: fails if I don't remember exact phrasing
- Manual scrolling: time-consuming, frustrating
- Cloud AI tools: privacy concerns, requires internet

**Success Criteria:**
- Semantic search returns relevant entries even with different wording
- Results show context (key lines + tags)
- Works completely offline
- Search is fast (<500ms for typical query)

---

### Job 3: Seeing Growth Without Judgment
**When** I look back at my journaling history  
**I want** to *see* my growth without feeling judged or shamed  
**So I can** feel motivated to continue without pressure

**Current Alternatives & Pain Points:**
- Streak counters: create anxiety when broken
- Calendar heatmaps: highlight gaps, trigger guilt
- No visualization: miss the satisfaction of progress

**Success Criteria:**
- Visual progress (Records Cavern) celebrates what *is* done
- No red X's or "missed day" notifications
- Artifacts and unlocks feel like discoveries, not achievements
- Can toggle off entirely with "Simple Mode"

---

### Job 4: Writing Offline, Always
**When** I'm offline (travel, airplane, no Wi-Fi, privacy mode)  
**I want** everything to still work perfectly  
**So I can** write whenever inspiration strikes, without technical barriers

**Current Alternatives & Pain Points:**
- Cloud apps: require internet, sync issues, slow startup
- Local apps: often lack intelligent features (search, AI)
- Hybrid apps: confusing what works offline vs. online

**Success Criteria:**
- Zero features require internet connection
- AI suggestions and semantic search work offline
- No "reconnecting" spinners or error messages
- Data saved instantly, no sync conflicts

## Secondary Jobs

### Job 5: Exporting My Data, My Way
**When** I want to preserve or move my journal  
**I want** to export everything in a portable, readable format  
**So I can** keep permanent backups or migrate if needed

**Success Criteria:**
- One-click export to `.chrxp` format (Markdown + attachments + metadata)
- Optional password protection
- Can re-import without data loss
- Markdown is human-readable without special tools

---

### Job 6: Customizing for My Brain
**When** I have specific cognitive or accessibility needs  
**I want** to adjust the interface to work for me  
**So I can** use the app comfortably for extended periods

**Success Criteria:**
- Dyslexia-friendly font option
- Adjustable line spacing and contrast
- Reduced motion mode
- Full keyboard navigation
- Low-stimulation color palette

---

### Job 7: Getting Unstuck When Blocked
**When** I don't know what to write about  
**I want** gentle, intelligent suggestions  
**So I can** start writing even when my mind feels blank

**Success Criteria:**
- Optional templates (e.g., "One-line check-in", "Three things today")
- AI-powered next-line suggestions (Muse) that can be ignored
- Concierge can suggest reflection prompts based on past entries
- Never feels pushy or mandatory

---

## Anti-Jobs (Things We Explicitly Do NOT Do)

### ❌ "Make me write every day"
We do NOT create obligation or guilt around daily journaling. Some people journal weekly, monthly, or sporadically — all are valid.

### ❌ "Share my thoughts with others"
We do NOT enable social features, sharing, or public journals. This is a private space.

### ❌ "Replace my therapist"
We do NOT provide mental health diagnosis, treatment, or crisis support. We may complement therapy but are not a substitute.

### ❌ "Monetize my data"
We do NOT collect, analyze, or sell user data. Privacy is a core feature, not a premium add-on.
