---

## Design Principles (Applied Throughout)

### 1. Neuro-Affirming UX
- **Low-stimulation default:** Soft colors, minimal animations
- **Clear hierarchy:** Obvious primary actions
- **No shaming:** Positive language, no "you missed a day"
- **Distraction-free:** Minimal chrome, focus on content

### 2. Keyboard-First Navigation
- Every feature accessible via keyboard
- Tab order logical (top-left ‚Üí bottom-right)
- Escape always closes modals
- Command Bar (Ctrl+K) as universal launcher

### 3. Privacy-First Design
- No telemetry, no analytics, no network calls
- Offline indicator (üì∂ Offline) is green (intentional)
- Encrypted vault password never visible
- Export/import local-only (.chrxp format)

### 4. Graceful Degradation
- AI features optional (can be disabled)
- Free tier fully functional (not crippled demo)
- Errors handled with recovery options (never dead ends)
