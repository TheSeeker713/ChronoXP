## 💙 Philosophy

> "Your thoughts are not noise. Your feelings are not too much. Your story matters. Keep writing."

ChronoXP is built on the belief that journaling should be:
- **Private** (no one reads your entries but you)
- **Encouraging** (not shaming you for missed days)
- **Accessible** (works for ADHD, dyslexia, low vision, screen readers)
- **Yours forever** (offline-first, exportable, no vendor lock-in)
